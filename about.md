## Hi! this is *Donna Bee* from my original name, Donna Baret.

### But why? 
I made this website so I have a repository of my hobbies... be it random k-pop visualizations, or one for greater good. My passions are preserving Filipino culture and  the environment

#### Nice to meet you on my page. I am excited to share you my analytics and lifestyle journey and in here.
I will share:
1. Notes from my analytics journey, cheat sheets through R, Python, and data analytics know hows so that I don't forget and  I can share as well.
2. Data Analytics Projects: From my Master's, to what my passions are
3. Book notes and reviews
4. _Adulting_ notes and stuff that is worth sharing (finance, fitness, career, relationships)
